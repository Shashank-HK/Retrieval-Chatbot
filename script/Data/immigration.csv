It is important to understand that reason behind non-issuance of passport is to ensure that the accused does not flee away, the victim gets justice, and proceedings can be continued. In this view, if the crime is not of a large magnitude, an application can be sent to the Court where the case is pending listing the reasons to obtain passport, desired dates of journey, and an assurance that the accused will not flee away.
