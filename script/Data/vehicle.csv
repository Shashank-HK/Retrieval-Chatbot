What is the guideline of Supreme Court of India for future prospects in case of motor accident victims,"A five-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court while hearing the case ï¿½National Insurance Company Limited v Pranay Sethi' agreed with the view on the standardization of the addition to revenue against future prospects in accordance with Article 168 of the Motor Vehicle Act 1988.

The determination of income in the calculation of remuneration must include future prospects so that the method will come into the line of just compensation as mentioned in terms of Section 168 of the Act. An addition of 50% of actual salary to the deceased's income relative to future prospects, where the deceased had a permanent job and was under 40 years old. The addition should be 30% if the age of the deceased was between 40 and 50 years. If the deceased was between the age of 50 and 60, the addition must be 15%. Actual salary must be read as actual salary less tax. If the deceased was self-employed or on a fixed salary, an addition of 40% of the income should be the warrant where the deceased was less than 40 years old. An addition of 25% where the deceased between the ages of 40 to 50 years and 10% where the deceased was between the ages of 50 and 60 should be regarded as the required calculation method. The established income means the income less the tax component.",vehicle
